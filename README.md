# Homework 1

For the first assignment, I created a MIPS program that prompts the user to type in their name and three numbers. With these numbers, I would perform three different operations. After it performs the operations, it will output the name, the numbers that the user typed in, and output of the three numbers after the three mathematical calculations.

# Homework 2

For the second assignment, I created a MIPS program that will use a dialog syscall that will allow the user to input a string. From thiere, this program will count the number of characters. From there, it will output the string and the character count. The dialog will be up if the user would like to type another string value. When the user is done, it will output a dialog message and then exit.

# Homework 7

For the seventh assignment, I created a MIPS program that will run a bubble sort and sort 500 items. I created another MIPTS program that will run a Selection Sort and sort the same 500 items. From there, I compared the differences between both of these sorts using the Instructions Counter Tool and the Cache comparision tool available in Mars.
